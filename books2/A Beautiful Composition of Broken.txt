dedication. 
to the wounded 
from the wounded 



intro. 



i took my expectations 



and buried them all 
at the bottom of the sea because i alone 



was never brave enough 



to dive that deep 



i took my pain 



the anguish 
and turned it into power i found more of myself 
in the loneliest of hours i used my tears to create rivers for my boat 
on disappointment and betrayal i float 



i float 



i took your absence 
as a sign to move on 
now the melody has changed and i sing a new song 


my heart, broken blue 



my mind split in two 



and yet i gained peace 



at the loss of you 



i took the heartache 



and learned a lesson 



i began after we ended 



you leaving was my blessing 



a love worth keeping. 



i wish 



i wish 



for love like this 



a love like summer 



being kissed by the sun 



a love like winter 
hugged and covered with snow a love like the night 
being lit by the moon’s glow i pray 



i pray 


that this never fades away many claims of being in love but none of them 
ever stay i hope 



i hope 



i rely on our love 



i rely on your heart 
i wish, i hope 



i pray we never part 



devil, defeated. 



i believe that the devil 



takes a bow 



when we lose 



delighted by our mistakes 
and the bad things that we choose delighted by our pain 



the devil does rejoice 



defeated by our demons 



the serpents who steal 



our voice 


but deep within the darkness there’s a light that we find a strength, a power 


something to free our mind something to free our soul we go to war to fight 
for peace bruised and battered 
and yet we find a way 
to bring the devil to his knees 



3:29:50 p.m. 
what is it that you love about him is it the way he lets you down incapable of 
lifting you up 


is it the way your heart breaks when he says something 


that shatters your self-esteem is it the fact he never shows up when you need 
him 



tell me again 



what is there to love 
about a man who doesn’t love you 



from pain, came this. 


my horror story began with you 
and ended with your departure 
the confusion and the pain of it all 
turned me into an author 


a poet for the poets 
a voice for the voiceless 
i speak for the weak 
i rally for the strong 



at 7:22 p.m., to my love. 


will you miss me when i’m gone what will the room sound like without my 
voice 


what will the room smell like without my scent 



my random sayings 



my cough 



my laughter 
me yelling when angry the sound of me weeping when sad 



my smile 



will you miss it 
my lips, my tongue 



the kissing 
when i vanish into air will you care 



will you grieve 



will you stay here 



in this home 



or will my absence 



make you leave 
all i ask is that you remember and that you never forget about me 



November ’13. 


lonely like the winter 
i searched for warmth 
and found nothing but cold air 
with nothing but pain living there 



seeds that grow. 


the suffering will make you strong 
the pain will help you grow 



you haunt the devil. 


transforming heartache into lessons 
refusing to remain down 
when falling 
not afraid to stare 
your abusers in the eyes 
the devil fears women like you 



soft light. 


your softness 
is your gift 
your sensitivity 
is beautiful 
most of who you are 
will go unappreciated 
by men 
who don’t deserve you 



anima I. 


loving yourself 
will save your soul 



anima II. 


you will find your soul mate 
when you fall for yourself first 



life jacket. 


you can’t save the person 
who refuses to appreciate 
or acknowledge your effort 


this is what i had to learn 
this is what i’ve come to accept 



a terrible terror of love I. 


it’s scary 
how you can do 
so much for someone 
and yet they’d rather focus 
on what you don’t do 



the false remains. 


i edit the memories of you 
pretending you thought more of me 
than what you actually did 


i’m much happier 
lying to myself 
about us 



mobile distractions. 


should’ve held my hand more 
instead of your phone 



a restless nightmare. 


my mental walls are crashing down on me 
wide awake in this nightmarish thought 
please save me from my own mind 



everything 7:22. 


she is both complex 
and easy to love 



mating souls 7:22. 


give me eternal promises 
an infinite love 
and i’ll give you mine 



whatever helps. 


you have been strong for so long 
cry if you need to 
scream if it helps 



much more. 


you are tougher than your demons 
you are greater than the pain 



both ways. 


take a lover 
who will choose you 
like you choose them 



begin again, again. 


you’re cold 
but you’ll love again 


when snow melts 
the flowers grow again 



learned lessons. 


gather the sorrow 
and let it teach you 
collect the heartache 
and heal 



different :22. 


i fell in love with your strange 
my heart fell for your crazy 



in your lips. 


with one kiss 
you make the madness 
of the world 
disappear 



removing you. 


screaming fuck you 
into the wind on a chilly night 
the moon is full 
as i empty myself of you 



retrieve self. 


sometimes i wish i could get back 
all of myself that i wasted on you 



internal blaze. 


the memory of you 
burns like a flame 
in my skull 



love :22. 


but when you touch me 
i remember how it feels 
to feel okay 



the lonely ones. 


you’re trying to be everything 
to someone who doesn’t care 
for you 



more lessons. 


having my heart broken 
helped me understand the true weight 
of holding on to the wrong person 



the terror. 


you’re terrified of feeling complete 
you have a fear of becoming whole 
and so you’ve accepted 
being broken 



we, like flowers. 


too soon 
the flowers dry up 
then die without warning 



the depth. 


there is so much more to you 
than your reflection in the mirror 
you are too deep for the understanding 
of shallow souls 



1:25. 
you are forgiven 
but there is no longer 
a space provided here 
for you 



mid-December lesson. 


not everyone you love 
deserves your patience 
not everyone you love 
deserves your fight 
not everyone you love 
deserves your heart 
not everyone you love 
understands that love 



late December love. 


we’re conditioned to love 
what we know 
and if all we know 
is pain 
this is what we tend 
to choose 



before ’13. 


i couldn’t stay 
my heart was too heavy 
for your hands 
my mind was too complex 
for you to comprehend 
and my soul was never yours 
to keep 



early mourning. 


in mourning 
i found truth 
in mourning 
i found clarity 
in mourning 
i found peace 



because i understand. 


there’s a black hole 
where your heart used to be 
and i won’t judge you for that 



less. 


i give minimal attention 
to those who do nothing 
but tear me down emotionally 
until i eventually 
give them nothing at all 



among the living. 


i went on living 
even when i felt like 
i couldn’t anymore 
even when i felt like 
i didn’t want to 



ongoing. 


your love is infinite 
find someone who understands this 



the after. 


in order to heal properly 
you must walk away 
from what broke you 



a grave love. 


for so long 
i was dating death 
falling deep into a grave 
that looked like love 



tender beginnings. 


who were you 
when you first fell in love 
a tender, timid heart 
a soul in search of longing 
vulnerable and beautiful 
unprepared for heartache 


the first one we love 
is often the one 
to teach us about pain 



Monday after 6. 


awkwardness and tension 
short questions met with short answers 
communicating without communication 
or comprehension 
no understanding 


we are no longer 
who we were before 
neither friend nor foe 
nothing, no one 
just two strangers 
who used to know 
one another 



a love i hate. 


a flame made weak by lies 
a love that fell flat after betrayal 
a heart, broken down 
by the very person who promised 
to protect it 


you were never my forever 
you were only my end 



Raymond’s literary grave. 


you were never as good 
as you pretended to be 
something short of what i am 
and so you’re jealous of me 


growing green with envy 
your soul is undone 
you’ve had many losses in your life 
you may count this as one 



blitz. 


with love comes several failures 
many attempts met unsuccessfully 



no start. 


and so we search for endless love 
in places where it’ll never begin 



battle tested. 


a woman is a warrior 
with infinite strength 



twenty 2. 


you began to talk like me 
your facial expressions like my own 
this is when i knew you were mine 



the sorrow. 


there’s nothing more confusing and painful to a woman 


than being told that she’s amazing by a man who treats her like she’s not 
good enough to commit to and the saddest part of it all is that this woman 
will fight to prove her value to the one man 
who doesn’t even deserve her 



the fight. 


the fight to prove yourself to someone who doesn’t deserve you is a losing 
battle 



what is there to achieve 



when the one you want 
has nothing to give you in return where is the benefit 
in going to war for someone who’d rather fight against you instead of beside 


you 



the questions I. 


here you are, alone 



taken but alone 



in a relationship 



that feels like a big 



question mark 



constantly wondering 



and wandering off 



into a thick silence 


struggling to find the words at odds with your own heart what should feel 
good 
has become painful to bear you wear sadness well 
but i can tell that you’re tired you’re fed up, you want out 



the wrong mate I. 


being with the wrong person 
is a time suck 
loving someone 
who refuses to love you 
drains the heart 


the soul becomes weary 
the longer you stay 
the opportunity to find 
your soul mate 
becomes greatly reduced 



the wrong mate II. 


real love arrives 
when the heart 
no longer clings 
to the wrong love 


real love can only be found 
when the heart 
no longer searches 
for it in the wrong places 



the problem. 


there’s the problem 
you say you want love 
but you’ve settled for someone 
who treats you like 
they hate you 



the silent. 


you can tell, you just know 
you always do 


no man on this earth 
could keep secrets 
from a woman like you 


but i hate this idea 
of knowing everything 
and saying nothing 
i hate this idea 
of a woman being silent 



the realization. 


here’s the thing 
i realized that being loved 
by you 
was completely overrated 



the lies. 


sure enough 
an honest love exists 
but we’re too busy 
entertaining the lies told 
by the people we think love us 



the choice. 


i didn’t quit 
i simply chose myself 
instead of continuing to try 
for someone who wouldn’t 
try for me 



the better. 


placing you behind me 
pushed me closer 
to something better 



the thought. 


i like to think 
that all the pain 
and heartache 
is simply preparing me 
for a love that heals 



the craving. 


sometimes the love you crave 
can’t be found in the person you want 
and wanting someone is not enough 
to have them love you 



the women. 


thank you to the women 
who never get a thank-you 
thank you to the women 
who never get acknowledged 


thank you for your softness 
thank you for your toughness 
thank you for your strength 
your endurance 
your ability to take pain 
and transform it into power 



the ability. 


i admire your ability to fight 
i admire your ability to go to war 
for all the things 
you know you deserve 



the bridge. 


sadly, i watched from the other side 
as you burned the one bridge 
that you never deserved to cross 



the further. 


you went missing 
when i longed for you the most 
while my heart didn’t grow fonder 
my mind grew further 
how quickly i went from sadness 
to feeling nothing at all 



the coffee shops. 


there’s this thing about coffee shops for the life of me 
it’s hard to put into words 



the experience my soul feels 
when all of my morning thrills 
sit at the bottom of that circular ceramic cup 



the atmosphere 



the people 
the lovers sitting hand in hand 
the friends, laughing silently 
me, gazing into the eyes of my lover speaking without saying words 



sipping slowly 



the sweet life 



the brown hue of enjoyment 



and delight 



sitting near the window 
in search of the perfect light 



the tights you wear. 


wrapped around both thighs 
black hues and heather grays 
beginning at the waist 
ending just at the ankles 
forcing me to pay homage 
to your curves 



the return. 


i should hate you 
but even then 
that would be way more 
than you actually deserve 
and so i’ll give you nothing 
to match the nothing 
you gave me in return 



the becoming. 



for so long 
the only one deserving of me 



was myself 



for so long 



i transformed 
into everything i needed for too long 
i’ve been disappointed by people who were never capable of becoming 
what i’ve always been struggling to find a love in others that i could easily 


cultivate on my own 



the internet. 



everything is fake deep nowadays 



life plagued by internet gurus 
teaching about a love they’ve 
yet to provide to the women 



in their lives 



fooling these hurt women 
who follow in search of clarity 
but confusion is all they’re selling stringing together words to create 


sentences to manipulate the masses 
of women who wish for nothing more than to be loved and cherished 


this hurts me . . . 



the social media. 


don’t drink their water 


don’t sip from their wells show no interest in what they offer stop buying 
what they’re selling silence their lies 



by not listening at all 
remove them from your timelines block their accounts 
don’t repost 
don’t like 
don’t bookmark 
don’t screenshot 
beware of deceitful people exploiting your vulnerabilities while filling their 


pockets by your desire to have the quick fix for your heartache that they’ve 
promised to provide but never do 



the questions II. 


are you tired 
are you weary 
are you unhappy 
have you accepted 
this fate 
have you allowed 
them to destroy you 
have you settled 
for this type of relationship 
knowing that you could have 
done better 
or are you unaware 
that something better exists 



the cold. 


next to you felt lonely 
next to you felt cold 
your presence felt like absence 
your love felt like pain 



the nights. 


we move on 
or at least we think we do 
hiding our pain with a smile 
locking away the memories 
behind the bars of our subconscious 
but the things 
we force ourselves to forgot 
creep up beside us 
in the middle of the night 



the questions III. 


are you awake 
i often wonder 
have you thought of me 
like i think of you 
is this as painful for you 
as it’s been for me 


i’m tired of needing you 
suffering from the realization 
that you never needed me 



wasn’t ready. 


we’re young, we’re just kids setting ourselves on fire for tainted love 
placing labels of forever on temporary people 


we’re so young 
and yet we’re so hurt 
we’re just teens 



acting like adults 



but no one taught us 



how to love correctly 



no one prepared us 



for this 
version of disappointment and we fall in love 
before we’re ready 



mold. 


pain shapes a woman 
into a warrior 



truly. 


a man who truly loves you 
chooses you every day 
he chooses you forever 



zero explanation. 


you don’t have to explain 
why you left 
to the person who made you leave 



quiet. 


don’t respond when you’re angry 
you end up saying things 
you don’t actually mean 
you end up hurting people 
you’re not supposed to hurt 
you end up saying things 
you’ll never be able to take back 



12 is hell. 


at midnight 
you haunt me 
at midnight 
i stay awake 
thinking about 
everything 
we used to be 



his confusion. 


a man who sends you mixed signals 
is a man who doesn’t deserve you 



the night is coming. 


briefly 
the sky a devilish red 
the sun setting behind 
the earth’s face 
i feel so alone 
sitting next to you 
my soul screams out 
in silence 
beneath the tension 
consumed by darkness 



bits of broken. 


break my heart 
and you’ll find fragments 
of all the love letters 
i wrote to you 
on each shattered piece 



the failure. 


i fail so often at love 
that i choose seclusion 
over the expectations 
that come with being 
in a relationship 



certamine. 


you struggle with love of self 
and so when someone truly 
adores your heart 
you struggle with believing them 



positionibus. 


i’m always apologizing 
when you hurt me 
after assuming that i was trying 
to hurt you, when i wasn’t 



no love near death. 


there is death 
in loving the wrong person 
i sit and watch so many 
of my peers die slow 



sine sensu. 


in love, alone 
overrun with the desire 
to feel nothing 
suffering from the curse 
of feeling everything 
for someone 
who feels nothing for you 



12:53. 
people who don’t feel good 
about themselves 
are always ready 
to make others feel bad 
about themselves 



spem. 


i hope you find someone 
who never makes you feel bad 
for being all that you are 



the empty and blissful. 


your apologies began to feel empty 
“i’m sorry” triggered no emotion 
to feel nothing for you 
was everything i thought 
it would be 
peaceful in the absence 
of your presence 



empty union. 


you not acknowledging 
the love i showed you 
will always be the worst part 
of our union 



always after midnight. 


i’m left rereading old messages 
sitting beneath the rubble 
of everything we used to be 
haunted, near the moon 
by everything we didn’t become 



quaestio. 


the only thing you were good at 
was making me feel like i was the problem 



in poetry. 


tears become words 
pain becomes strength 
heartbreak becomes a testimony 
of how i found myself 
after losing you 



me, you. 


encounter me 
and find the love 
you deserve 



untitled I. 


stay close to the people 
who remind your soul 
to remain strong 



Marie. 


i want to live on the pages 
of your heart 
i want to find life 
in the stories 
that make you smile 



you, your heart. 


falling apart doesn’t make you weak 
a strong heart is capable of breaking 



no solutions. 


i wanted to try 
i was willing to fight for this 
you wanted a way out 
you never cared as much as me 



takes time sometimes. 


every time you answer their call 
or reply to their text 
you have to restart the process 
of moving 



assist. 


she doesn’t always 
have to save herself 
the queen doesn’t have to be 
content with standing alone 
being strong doesn’t have 
to feel lonely 
it’s okay to let someone take care of you 
while you work on loving yourself 



3:27. 
the person who deserves your love 
won’t treat you poorly 
love is not an excuse 
to stay with someone 
who can’t love you correctly 



no courage. 


i could have been your everything 
but you didn’t have the courage 
to love me in the way i needed 



newfound. 


sometimes i miss the anticipation 
that attaches itself to new love 
the longing and newfound desire 
to learn everything about a beautiful stranger 



all the tales we tell. 


incapable of facing the painful reality 
of a love that’s been lost 
we lie in the form of false memories 
re-creating disaster and chaos 
into beautiful moments 
that never happened 



after all, in the end. 


oftentimes 
tragedy transforms 
into beauty 


delightful things occur 
in the aftermath of chaos 


just be patient 



to our seeds. 


one day i may have daughters 
and i don’t want them to believe 
that their independence is a burden 
or restriction on love 



no restriction. 



your independence is not 



some curse or restriction 


your independence doesn’t have 


to be an excuse as to why you’re single you still deserve to be loved correctly 
your independence should be celebrated and supported while in a 
relationship being independent doesn’t make you unlovable being 
independent doesn’t mean 


you always have to fight alone 


independent women still deserve the deepest love 



and wanting to be loved 



and cared for 
doesn’t have to compromise 
a woman’s strength and independence 



7:14. 
strong women only intimidate 
the type of men that’ll never 
be able to comprehend 
or understand their worth 



all of her. 


a body betrayed 
a heart destroyed 
a mind in confusion 
and yet a woman 
is capable of taking pain 
and transforming it into triumph 



healthy spirit. 


more mental health 
and a peace of mind 
protect your right 
to feel at ease 



coffee and a book. 


shades and shadows 
the smell of coffee beans 
sits in my nostrils 
the taste of Colombia on my tongue 
the pages of my favorite book 
between my fingers 
my morning bliss 
has just begun 



internet trolls. 


i give silence to your criticism as you’ve decided to exaggerate your own 
importance to my art i give silence to your opinions because in my opinion 



you are wrong 


i give silence to your anger because i’m happy and in love i give silence to 
your opinion while you remain below 



i rise above 



sick day. 


give your soul a break 
if you’re tired of being hurt 
just rest awhile 



not a victim, victor. 


hate me, i love it 
get angry, i’ll just laugh 



March 17th I. 


i got tired of practicing 
the self-destruction 
of fighting for someone 
who would rather fight 
against me 


that’s not love 



March 17th II. 


if you’re in a relationship 
with someone who 
doesn’t respect your mind and heart 
it’s time to move on 
without that person 


if you’re in a relationship 
that doesn’t support your joy 
and peace of mind 
it’s time to move forward 
without that person 



March 17th III. 


feel what you feel but also understand 
that most people don’t deserve 
an emotional reaction from you 


you are valuable 
you are grand 
you are the essence of strength 
don’t let them break you 



March 17th IV. 


you’re always trying 



but who tries for you 
you’re always fighting 



but who fights for you 
i hate this idea of everything falling upon the shoulders 



of a woman 


while she’s in a relationship with a man who makes no effort i hate this idea 
of a woman feeling alone while being 



in a relationship 



March 17th V. 


i learned so many lessons in love 
the hard way 
i learned that loving someone 
doesn’t simply make them the one 


i learned that love 
in its purest form 
can only be provided 
and accepted when 
you love yourself first 



March 17th VI. 


there is value in your presence 
there is value within your heart 
and not everyone can afford 
to be with someone like you 
that’s fine 



March 17th VII. 


for me personally 
i would not have found love 
in someone else 
until i found it in its 
purest form within myself first 


you are the beginning 
it all starts with you 
the love you long for 
must first be cultivated on your own 
by yourself 



March 17th VIII. 


i think what we’ve found in dating 
is that sometimes 
the people we care for are incapable 
of caring for us the way we need 


we discover through relationships 
that sometimes the person 
we fall for cannot comprehend 
the love we provide 



March 17th IX. 


having standards is not a burden 
being strong is not a burden 
the mate you choose 
should always choose you 
just you 



March 17th X. 


the love you accept 
shouldn’t hurt you 
the relationship you entertain 
shouldn’t cause confusion 



a terrible terror of love II. 


it’s scary how dedicated 
you can be to someone 
who would rather use their energy 
to attempt to destroy you 



cost of communication. 


know your worth 
and never communicate 
reply or respond to anyone 
who can’t afford to speak to you 
or with you 



she, you, woman. 


delicate yet strong 
there’s a certain balance 
that only a woman like her 
can obtain 


she knows what she deserves 
and provided anything less 
she’ll walk away in search of more 


she’s guarded, sure 
but she’s ready to open up 
to the one who deserves her 



6:42. 
you’ve been hurt 
you’ve made your mistakes 
you’ve been called out 



of your name 
you’ve felt broken 
you’ve fallen down 
you’ve had to pick up the pieces of your heart and start over 
you’ve been mishandled, neglected disrespected and you’ve felt unprotected 


all of which has caused you to guard your heart but you’re stronger look at 
what you’ve been through you’re a queen who always gets through you’re a 
woman who continues to survive 



it’s evident. 



something within you 
is hurting, you’re in pain 
and it shows in the songs 



you relate to 



the quotes and poetry 
you double-tap on social media 
and of course it’s evident 
from the way these words make you feel but things do change, as you know 


things do get better and they will 



6:53. 
so many things i need to work on 
so many fucking things i need to change 



false claims of real love. 


i find that it’s difficult 
to find a heart that wants 
to love you permanently 
so many “i love yous” 
from people who don’t 
intend to stay 



7:05. 
don’t let the pain 
of any past relationship 
prevent you from finding 
something genuine and real 
in the future of something new 



weak critique. 


i’ve come to realize that 
negative criticism 
often arrives from the lips 
of someone incapable of accomplishing 
the things you can 



the roses. 


she is a storm of roses 
dangerous but beautiful 



8:32. 
too often the heart 
finds a way to love 
the ones who will never 
love it back 



broken chains. 


loving myself more 
set me free of you 



daydreaming life. 


my life rarely fits 
the picture i draw up 
in my head 


having certain expectations 
has ruined me 



the levels. 


there are several levels to love 
don’t be afraid to reach 
for the highest 



a short moment. 


the truth hurts 
and so we find peace 
in lies that create 
a temporary happiness 



the never-ending never. 


hating kills progression 
i know this because 
all the people who hate me 
will surely never surpass me 



8:49. 
my ego and my soul 
have found the perfect compromise 



a void. 


i felt like a bookstore 
with no books on its shelves 
a profound emptiness 
in my soul 



demands never met. 


somehow i’d always feel 
a deep regret when asking for more knowing damn well 
that having any sort of expectation would ruin me in ways 



that i could never imagine 



while my requests were met 


with nothing or lack of effort i was simply demanding everything i knew i 
deserved 
everything you weren’t willing to give and i know that now 



knowing you. 


who are you when no one is watching 
can i trust that person to remain loyal 
without my watchful eyes 


who are you when my back is turned 
can i trust that person to be honest 
in my absence 



i see a lifetime in brown eyes. 



the morning comes too soon 
your eyes a weary shade of brown 



your hair twisted and tangled 



restless and yet you smile 
the sun rises on your face 



shining brighter than before 
you lean in to whisper “i love you” 
but in this moment, i love you more 



March 23rd. 


i’ve become a flower and rose 


enthusiast because i’ve fallen in love i’ve come to the realization that loving 
a woman 
means making an effort to make her smile at all times 


why give her grief and sorrow 
when you can give her roses 
that scream “i love you” 



24 hours. 


i do whatever i can 
to protect my partner’s peace of mind 
when you love someone 
you keep that relationship secure and safe 
love shouldn’t feel like chaos and hell 



a truth I. 


holding on to someone 
who doesn’t care about losing you 
causes you to lose yourself 
and self-esteem 



i witnessed. 


watching you decide 
to miss out on real love 
because you’d rather hold on 
to someone who doesn’t love you 
is the hardest part 



a truth II. 


your opinion of me 
will never define who i truly am 
and whatever you think of me 
holds no importance in my life 



surviving oceans. 


we’re drowning for people who refuse to pull us from an ocean of despair 
we’re drowning for people who tipped us over 
forcing us to be submerged by our own pain 
we’re drowning as they watch without a care in this world we’re drowning 


and only we can save ourselves 



mature men. 


having many women means nothing 
being able to juggle several women 
doesn’t make you a man 
but the strength and determination 
to love and be faithful to one does 



further from truth. 


amazing isn’t it 
the way that every lie that gets told 
contains just enough truth to seem believable 
but not enough truth to be true 



a truth III. 


the woman who asks for more 
isn’t asking for too much 
the woman who demands more 
is simply in search of everything 
she deserves 



a truth IV. 


and that’s the issue 
sometimes when you see what you want 
you forget what you need 
and what you accept is further 
from what you deserve 



noncombative. 


the beauty in being secure with self 
is that you never have to defend your ideas 
or your actions 
with people who don’t matter 



ability. 


she has the patience to stay 
and the strength to move on 



valued. 


when a man realizes the value 
of the woman who shares herself with him 
he adds value to himself 



uncontrollable. 


seek the approval of no one 
never change who you are 
to fit the mold that others 
have created for you 



imitation. 


some apologize 
because they mean it 
others apologize 
because they’ve gotten caught 



withdrawn but progressive. 


i’m constantly evolving 
i just wish you were involved 
and a part of this change 


i’ve been doing this without you 
but i’m fine 



beneath above. 


she desires a patient partner 
one who will dig deeper 
making sure she reaches 
her peak 



lower. 


understand that a woman’s love 
is something that runs deep 
if you’re not ready and willing 
to reach her depths 
don’t attempt the dive 
don’t waste her time 



inner, deeper. 


when i hear the word “woman” 
so many things come to mind 



my thoughts are overtaken 



by great things and visions 


i value the essence, mind 
and the very being of a woman 


see, many men look at a woman 
and categorize her by the way she looks reducing her to her appearance 
but i see more than that 


i’m willing to go to the depths 
of the soul, the mind 



its core 


the most beautiful woman is far more than a beautiful structure or what she 
appears to be to the naked eye the most beautiful woman has gold running 
through her veins and magic living within her heart 


you are that woman . . . 



sex, poetry in motion. 



let us lie 



beside 



beneath 



one another 
using our emotions to convey express 
and act out the actions of our mind body 



soul 



and heart 


sex is poetry in motion with a touch of love adding meaning to what is 
already beautiful you and i 



beneath the moon 
covered in darkness let us create 



let us write 



when together. 


touch her in a way that no one 



has done before 



stimulate her entire mind 



with an abundance of words 
and leave an imprint upon her soul create a long-lasting memory 
and become something she’ll 



never forget 



a lasting impression is what 



you should always aim for 



appreciate all that she is 
and all that she’s willing to offer it’s what she deserves 



11:59. 
she knew what she had to do 
and as the clock counted down 
the new year would stare her 
right in the face 
urging and pleading for her 
to make the necessary changes 
to bring forth the love 
she desired and deserved 



12:00. 
but that’s the thing 
the most honest and hurtful truth i don’t think they changed 



they simply became more 



of who they always were 
and the person you see now 



is the type of person 
you’ve tried your hardest 
to avoid but it’s hard to let go because you’ve already fallen for them 



12:07. 
you’ve been holding on 



to someone who no longer 



deserves your grip 


you’ve lost countless hours of sleep thinking about someone who doesn’t 
deserve to be on your mind 


you’ve displayed an amazing ability to care so deeply unconditionally and 
you’re beautiful because of that one day you’ll be rewarded 
with a love that mirrors your own but first you must move on 
without the person who refuses to love you 



12:21. 
i can’t stay here 
i’m tired of being tired 
i’m exhausted from yelling and not being heard 


i no longer wish to fight with someone who refuses to fight for me i am no 


longer willing 
to wear this coat of unhappiness i miss my smile and i’ll only find it with you 
gone 


but instead of asking you to go 
i’ll leave 



killing the cycle. 


not again 
never, not anymore 
i can’t 
i won’t 
i’m done 
i’m gone 



12:29. 
lately 
you haven’t been yourself 
your laughter isn’t as loud 
your smile appears to be forced 
and i just think you’d do well 
with focusing more on yourself 
for a while 



you, royal. 


today, just like any other day 
you’ll rise from the ashes 
a fire set by those who wish 
for you to fail 
and the prayer in your heart 
will remain stronger 
than the words of your enemies 


you are mighty 
and your strength 
is your crown 



broken nightmare. 


you refused to live 
within the nightmare 
sold to you as a dream 


you finally woke up 



sharp. 


open your damn eyes 
your suspicion can be justified 
by their actions as of late 
don’t second-guess your heart 
you know the truth 



to the root. 


and they wonder why 
you have trust issues 
or act as if you don’t 
give a fuck 


the way you are 
the way you love 
is a product 
of being taken 
for granted 



August 29th. 


some relationships 
are just hurtful distractions 
keeping you from the love 
you long for 



12:50. 
be with me 
and only me 
choose me always 
because i’ll always 
choose you 



much for nothing. 


she poured her heart out to me on pages i refused to read 



texting me every night 
“you are all that i need” 



blinded by a situation 



blurring my ability to see 



she screamed 
“i know that this means nothing but you mean everything to me” 


so consistent were her efforts she was willing to wait 



she said 
“you think you love this girl but you’re my soul mate” 


her heart cries in need of me but her smile is all they see it meant everything 
to her 


but never meant much to me 



hoarding of the past. 


my home is overflowing 
with things i’ll never need 
no space for anything new 
because i’m holding on to things 
from my past that have no value 
in the present 



in the ashes of. 


burn bridges for warmth 
burn bridges for light 
burn bridges to others 
who don’t deserve 
to get to you 



1:21. 
i am cold 
i am warmth 
i am numb 
i feel everything 
i am all but nothing 
i give love and i hate it 



Plath. 


reading Sylvia’s words 
wishing i could save her 
wishing i could tell her 
that it will get better 



stillness. 


you speak 
in silence 
so well 



finis. 


it all falls on me 
the weight of it all 
crushing my spirit 
like bone meeting iron 
i’m breaking down 
collapsing completely into 
myself 


until there’s nothing left 
but the regret 
of trying so hard 
for someone who couldn’t 
try for me 


i’m done 



the wrong, the negative. 


the right people help you feel 
the right things 
the wrong people encourage 
all of the emotions 
you don’t want to feel 
stay away from the wrong people 



belief in the process. 


learning to detach from things 
that serve no purpose in my life 



busy. 


being busy keeps the soul happy 
doing nothing makes you feel 
like nothing 



transformations. 


they chose to be sheep 
she decided to be a wolf 



deeply mad. 


love me madly 
like crazy is the new sane 



i feel both entirely. 


i am both happy and sad 
i feel weak but i am strong 
i am broken but i’ll be whole 
there is hope within pain 
there is hope after heartache 
and i’ve felt both of everything 
i know that it gets better 



book of souls. 


read her like books 
that intrigue the soul 



careful as i choose. 


i’m careful about the people 
i choose to entertain 
because attention can become love 
and love can feel like hell 
when given to the wrong person 



you live in these words. 


come 
see yourself in these words 
come alive within my poetry 
find clarity and peace 
within the pages of this book 
allow my art to touch your soul 
allow these words to grasp your heart 



child of the moon. 


you are a living extension 
of the moon in the night 
a light that shines the brightest 
during the darkness 



the hurting of self. 


you’ve been chasing 
all the ones who will never 
love you 
distracting yourself 
from the one 
who deserves that love 



in gardens we wait. 


each of us, roses 
waiting to be picked 
chosen by the hand 
who isn’t afraid of our thorns 



searching the emptiness. 


isn’t that how it always begins attraction sparked by the surface something 
pleasing for the eye something hopeful for the heart here you are spending 
your days and nights 



in search of someone 



to take the pain away 



but what you discover 
is someone who creates more pain 



for the culture. 


someone tagged me in a photo 
with my words on their skin 
i lost a lot of friends on this journey 
but something like that feels like a win 



more aqua. 


drink more water 
and stay away from people 
with negative attitudes 
and petty behavior 



maintaining peace I. 


being with someone who refuses 
to protect your heart 
will distract you from the things 
that would otherwise make you happy 


the saddest part of it all 
is that we’ll claim to want peace 
and yet we’ll settle for 
a chaotic relationship 
then complain about it 



maintaining peace II. 


the worst kinds of people 
are those who are unhappy 
with your need to experience happiness 
detach from these types of people 



a table for one. 


your words are no longer yours 
your voice the tone of someone else’s 
you’ve changed who you are 
for validation and profit 
still, you’ve discovered 
that success only arrives 
to those who remain authentic 
and this is why you 
continue to lose 



overdone, exhausting. 


trying until trying 
is something that i’ll no longer do 
loving you until 
i realize that it’ll change nothing 
these things take time 
and i’m patient 



a refusal, a strength. 


i’m finding more of myself 



in my journey toward peace 
learning to let go of the anger that once plagued my soul 



and altered the direction 



of most of my days 
i’m finding my voice 



beneath the heaviness 
of the pain that once caused me to shut down 



refusing to remain silent 
about the things that broke me i refuse to be a prisoner of heartache 



afraid, my silence. 



we lie to ourselves 
we hide behind our own masks 



we suppress our truths 


with tall drinks and loud music self-medicating with sex 


self-harming with acts of recklessness we’d rather pretend to be happy 
instead of cultivating long-term happiness smiling to cover up the emotional 
bruises left upon our soul by lovers 



who never loved us 


giving off the appearance of strength while breaking down deep within and 
yet no one ever knows 
because being strong often means being silent 


i hate that i allowed my voice to be silenced by my inability to ask for help 
i hate that i allowed this pain to consume me in a way 
that no one will truly know about afraid to admit to myself that i cared 


because accepting the truth 
would reveal the hurt that found its way into my heart 



4:00. 

up early 



while the world 



is still dreaming 
it’s 4 a.m. 
and the city that never sleeps is sleeping as this is written wide wake 
lying beside my dream girl proving once more 
that dreams come true and you don’t have to be asleep to bear witness to it 


all 



4:32. 

the unfortunate truth 



of going to bed angry 
is that you wake up weary 
drained by the sadness that follows and it swallows you up 
with whatever good you had left you wake up tired 



longing for peace 



but it easily escapes you 



because in that moment 


you’re too tired to pursue it change the way you go to sleep and you’ll wake 
up better 
stronger, wiser 



clarity in mourning. 


i tried 
you didn’t 
i loved 
you refused 
it was me 
and never you 
it was you 
not wanting me 
stuck, searching for you 
when all i needed was myself 



the love you deserve. 



they want you 



but none of them 



deserve you 



they like you 



but none of them 



will love you 



take your time 
and find more of yourself before searching for more of someone else 



the love you desire 
needs to be cultivated within you first 
before you can find it elsewhere 



the optimism and delight. 



a different you 



sitting in a brighter hue 
gone are the days of darkness 
gone, the days of sadness 



a smile that bears light 
like the sun rising against the ocean a laughter that bears life 
like a tree standing in the forest this is my hope for you 
and i know you’ll find it someday 



when night falls. 


good mornings 
can replace bad nights 
never underestimate 
the sun burning out 
the darkness 



create more. 


don’t let your past corrupt 
the present 
don’t let the painful memories 
you’ve created 
keep you from the creation 
of something better 



from it, stronger. 


the pain will bring you strength 
the heartache will give you purpose 



more you, mighty. 


somehow the sorrow 
made you this 


wise 
stronger 
beautiful 
more of you 



pursuing nothing. 


the wrong love 
feels like death 
and i felt myself 
slipping away 
while chasing after you 



with the absence of you. 


apparently i never needed you 
i know this now 
as i found everything i wanted 
without you here 



you, a delight. 


you are an unforgettable moment 
a lifetime of delight 
don’t let them fool you into thinking 
that your presence means nothing 
don’t let them fool you into thinking 
that somehow you’re ordinary 



Dahlia. 


i haven’t spoken to my mother 
in such a long time 
so long, that pieces of me 
have begun to fade 
into everything we used to be 
and everything i used to feel 
becomes lost with time 



too long, the distance. 


it takes us too long 
to figure out that love 
doesn’t have to hurt 
and the love we give 
is too precious to be given away 
to someone who refuses 
to give it back 



remember before. 


who were you 
before sadness overran your heart 


i hope you remember 
what it felt like to be happy 



on your own, within. 


find your calm 
reclaim your peace 
re-create the love 
you couldn’t find in others 



become it. 


the only one worthy of you 
is you 
in this moment 
you only need yourself 


become the love 
that they refused to share with you 



be loud, no silence. 


find your strength 
find the courage 
reclaim your voice 
and say what you need 
to say 
do not be silent 
be loud 
be unapologetic 
be entirely you 
without regret 



distancing a memory. 


every day since we ended 
i’ve developed new ways 
to push you further 
from my memory 
i want you out 
of my mind 



as i recall. 


a strong memory 
is the destroyer 
of the heart 



starlit. 


count the stars 
that live within yourself 
you’re brighter than you know 



:09. 


loving you drained my spirit 



:11. 


do it 
on your own 
do it 
for yourself 
do it 
at your own pace 



:14. 


i know too much 
and say too little 
while screaming 
on the inside 



fin, love. 


we ended 
i was never yours 
to have, to hold 
to keep 



mind, the enemy. 


i struggled to forget 
but you’ve forgotten me already 



read, lover. 


books stained with the tears 
of the reader with the broken heart 
books held tight 
like lovers in the dark 
sometimes all you have are the words 
sometimes all that’s left 
are the books 



text ignored, no response I. 


please 
text me back 


are you 
still mad 


say something 
if not anything else 


tell me what to do 


i’ll do better 
i can be better 


help me understand 
can i have another chance 



submerged, fighting. 


i’m here 
in the deep end 
struggling to save myself 
while you watch me drown 



text ignored, no response II. 


please don’t leave me 
i get it now, i understand 


i still need you 


we were happy 
i don’t know what changed 


are you there 
are you listening 
don’t shut me out 



fade into shadows. 


we were happy once 
the sun shined its light 
on us, together 
but the love faded 
into the shadows of the sunset 
and here we are 
filled with nothing 
showing shades of emptiness 
a void no longer filled 
with love and respect 



strangers again, again. 


we started as strangers 
we ended that way 
sometimes the beginning 
is the same as the ending 



my response I. 


fuck the writers 
who write irrelevant things 
about me 
because they’re incapable 
of writing anything as relevant 
as what i’ve written 



my response II. 


fuck the writers 
who gang up to accuse 
or abuse the authors 
who achieve more than 
they ever will 
or ever thought possible 



my response III. 


may your hatred become a shovel that digs your own grave 


my hope is that you rest in peace with the hateful words you spewed directly 
or indirectly 


these words, this book 
in memory of all the people 



who dislike me 



or others like me 



a funeral held for those 



who will soon be forgotten 



buried beneath my words 



buried beneath my success 



no longer. 



after begging for a truth 
that has been kept from you 



emotional exhaustion sets in 
you’ve been strong but now 
you’re tired of being lied to 
you’re tired of being denied 
the respect that you’ve fought for while fighting for a space in their life the 


begging and pleading 
is replaced with the silence of anger the silence of resentment 
the silence that seems the loudest as your refusal to speak 



screams of your disappointment 



and your newfound commitment 



to yourself 


a silent declaration of the desire to now detach your heart 
from the heart that hurts you 
after demanding the truth for so long you’ve reached your breaking point 



untold tale. 


sometimes i wish 
i could take my secrets back 
i hate the fact that you know me 
in ways you didn’t deserve 



aching. 


it hurts 
the pain of feeling nothing 
the realization that being numb 
is best 


it hurts because 
i’d like to feel again 
but i’m afraid of feeling for 
the wrong person 



a quiet expression. 


the silence tells me everything 
a wordless expression 
a quiet resentment and regret 


you can almost hear everything 
that isn’t being said 



a nonexistent us. 


i am becoming less afraid 
of a reality that isn’t centered around us 
i am becoming more accepting 
of a life lived without you 



blurred self. 


all of this 
all of that 
all of me 
but it was 
never enough 


the pursuit of you 
destroyed my self-esteem 



a teen spirit. 


i want to slow dance to Nirvana 
with you, love 



agonize. 


we search for something 
to take the pain away 
but what we find is someone 
who causes more pain 



a wishing well. 



i really wish you well 
i hope things get better for you i hope you change your ways 
i don’t wish the pain you caused me on anyone else 
and so i hope your heart learns to feel love in its purest form because if it 


doesn’t 
you’ll miss out on something real just as you missed out on being with me 



potion. 


she refused to be anyone’s cup of tea 
she was more so the finest glass of whiskey 



vex. 


it’s fucked up 
because the people 
who break you 
are always okay 
while you’re in pain 



discern, you. 


your smile breaks my heart 
because it’s not real 
and as much as i care 
there’s nothing i can do 
to help but give you these words 
in hopes of letting you know 
that you’re not alone 


i see you . . . 



comrade. 


you are your own best friend 
don’t abandon yourself 
become everything you need 



retain. 


so many men know 
what it takes to make 
a woman fall in love 
but most of them 
can’t comprehend what it takes 
to keep a woman in love 



not adequate. 


you were only good 
at pretending to be 
what i wanted 
but you were never 
good enough for me 



looking glass. 


sometimes everything you’re looking for 
hides within your own reflection 


it’s time to start looking for you 
it’s time to start looking for yourself 



tussle. 


i know you can do this 
if you can’t be strong 
be brave, keep fighting 



a sturdy heart. 


and if on this day 
all you did was smile 
even while you wanted 
to break down 


be proud of yourself 
for standing 
while wanting to fall 



factual. 


a man who loves you 
will not force you to compromise 
your emotional well-being 
or the health of your heart 



campaign. 


women are warriors 
without physical weapons 
the way they use their minds 
to conquer whatever attempts 
to break them 



March 25th. 


it’ll happen 
you’ll either entertain 



or fall for someone 
who made you feel as if 



they were the one 



it happens often 



you meet a person 



you get to know them 
feelings begin to surge throughout your heart and you start to imagine 



a future with that person 
it happens to the best of us 



things begin to change 



that feeling of security 



begins to fade 
as that relationship goes on 



you find yourself fighting 
to stay afloat on a boat 



that is slowly sinking 


you plug those holes with denial you plug those holes with lies telling 
yourself it’s okay 



you make excuses 
for the way that person treats you you start to lose yourself 
because you’re more concerned with keeping a person that appears to no 


longer care about keeping you 



March 26th. 


when you go back to someone 
who mistreated you 
you’re cheating yourself 
out of an opportunity 
to be with someone 
who will always consider your feelings 



her silence, a sign. 


sometimes a woman’s silence 
serves as proof that she no longer 
gives a fuck 
and you’re no longer worth 
her energy 



more, most. 


you deserve the deepest 
most sincere form of pleasure 



December 27th. 


i’m beginning to wake up 



love is blind at times 
but time also has a way 
of waking us up to the bullshit that often attaches itself 
to loving someone who can’t provide the same level of love 



we express 



we often settle 



failing to realize 



that there exists someone 



capable of reflecting 



the same level of love 



we give them 



January 1st. 


loving the wrong person 
provides a lesson 
in what to look for 
as far as warning signs 
within your future relationships 



January 1st, 8:55 p.m. 


it’s amazingly sad 


when someone fails to understand how much you truly care for them but 
you can’t hold on to that pain one day they’ll look back 



with so many regrets 
and you’ll be with the one 



who loves you back 
you’ll be with someone 
who would fight to keep you 



January 4th, 5:43 p.m. 


my heart is open once more 



after being closed 



while with someone 
who promised to keep it safe time alters what’s familiar people change 



you never see it coming 



hesitant to love again 
but again my heart is open 
you’ve felt what i felt 



so let us fall together 
and i’ll help you fix 



what he has broken 



January 7th, 8:49 p.m. 


before i get the chance 
to place my hands on your skin 
i’d first like the opportunity 
for our souls to collide 
our minds to be fully stimulated 
and our hearts to be in sync 


this is the way i’d like to love you 



January 7th, 8:26 a.m. 


on this morning 
i feel at ease 
the stress has gone 
i can’t truly explain what i feel 
at this very moment 
but it’s a feeling that has escaped me 
for far too long 


i’m okay 
on a path to being happy again 



8:39:52 p.m. 
i’d love every part of you 
if you allowed it 
inside and out 



5:27:15 p.m. 
and the silence is all you have 
to offer to those 
you no longer give a fuck about 



4:23:08 p.m. 
what i desire more than anything 
is a relationship with someone 
who doesn’t mind the idea 
of spending a lifetime with one person 



7:52:20 p.m. 
i couldn’t help myself 



before i knew it 
my hands were on her thigh 
her skirt beginning to rise with no desire to rush 



i inched my fingers 
a bit closer to her flower 



as i preferred the act 



to unfold organically 
i then touched her in a way that caused a weakness 



within her spine 


ever so apparent by the way she lay down on my mattress like rain, falling 
from a cloud “it’s been a while,” she whispered as i proceeded to take her 



January 10th. 


this craving to explore 
the unfamiliar places within you 
has overtaken my mind 


i’d like to get lost in you 
i’d like the opportunity 
to make you feel things 
you’ve never felt for anyone else 



9:29:13 a.m. 
i woke up with the taste of her 
still lingering on my tongue 
erotic visuals burned into my mind 
her skin slightly wet 
from the activity we engaged in 


“it’s yours,” she whispered 
muffled moans became screams 
as i explored the deepest parts 
of her existence 



9:29:38 p.m. 
i’m addicted to this idea 
of your legs wrapped around 
my waist 
holding me in place 
as if to say 
you’ll never let me go 



wet walls. 


can we pause for a second 
and thank the heavens for angels with strong wings 



and soft skin 



inner thighs like pillows 
legs that bow like oval shapes wrapped around my face 
like blindfolds made of silk i stopped wishing for moments like this the very 


moment you allowed me to live it 
completely, explicitly 
your openness as wide as your spread eagle your wet walls 
like the insides of our mouths warm and waiting 
i’ve been anticipating you just as much as you’ve been wanting me 



6:16 p.m. 
utilizing my tongue 
as a stress reliever 
pressing pressure points 
creating a climax 
provoking pleasure 
with ease 
opening you right up 
because my tongue 
is the key 



guide me. 


i’d like to get lost in you 
mind, body, and soul 
travel the avenues that lead me to a greater understanding of you show me 


your fears, the horror the pain, the struggle 



reveal your thoughts 



as you overthink 



show me the flaws 


you try your hardest to hide the sadness that sits beneath your smile i’d like 
to know the real you the you that you’re afraid 



to show the world 



the girl behind the shade 



of a fake smile 
i want to see the things 
that you think will chase me away i’d like to understand 
and later learn to love you 



for who you truly are 



profess, encourage. 


teach the many possibilities 
to a child 
never make a child feel like 
their dreams are impossible 
to achieve 



a healing. 


when i open the book 
i turn off the pain 



the reader. 


the girls who love books 
have the sweetest love to give 



a rare find, love. 


give me something 
that can’t easily be found 
help me rediscover 
new reasons to smile 



the carving of. 


you’ve written your initials 
on my soul 
your love, carved into me 



let us begin, love. 


i want you wildly 
and recklessly 


i want you here 
right next to me 


i want the adventure 
in your heart 


so take my hand 
and we can start 



wanting, afraid. 


you are everything i want 
you are everything i’m afraid of 
this craving for love 
met with the fear of getting hurt 


but i’ll risk it all 
for a moment on your mind 
and a place in your heart 



7:22:22 p.m. 
i see love in those brown eyes 
i see warmth in your embrace 
i feel a forever whenever i’m with you 



memory museum. 


i relive all of the moments 
we’ve shared 
and all of the memories we’ve created 
every time my lips touch yours 



the broken meet the broken. 


a love between two broken people can feel whole and complete 


maybe we’re puzzles 
and you were holding the piece i needed the entire time 
i just had to find you first 



scary in the beginning 
as your pain matched my own 
both hurt and burned by love 



we met one another 



we held one another 



then fell for one another 



both of our scars visible 
and yet the vision of us together still remained beautiful 



feeling, hiding. 


you ever get so sad 
that you laugh 
you ever feel so hurt 
that you smile 


we’re so good at hiding 
behind what we wish to feel 
we’re so good at pretending 
to feel nothing 
when we feel everything 



behind hate, behind pain. 


i finally realized 
that love hides itself 
behind the people who hurt us 


meaning, 
you have to look beyond the pain 
to find the love you deserve 


it’s always there 
you just have to stop letting 
certain people distract you from it 



no shame on the broken. 


broken people need to understand 
that being hurt is nothing to be ashamed of 
and just because you’re broken 
doesn’t mean you’ll never find a pure love 



aware, mindful. 


depression has eaten its way 
to my heart 
there’s a sadness that lingers there 


my mind overrun by painful thoughts 
sometimes i hate being this aware 



harsh lessons. 


the one person 
who was supposed to help me 
fix this shit 
was the first person 
to leave when i needed them the most 


this was one of the harshest lessons 
i’d ever learn 


sometimes the only person 
you need is yourself 



the mental freedom. 


thinking about you 
sucked me further 
into darkness 


and as hard as it’s been 
i’ve been working harder 
to free my mind of you 



the slow burning of regret. 


i hope the memory of me 



burns through your mind 
and in times of desperation i hope you reach for me 
then realize that i can no longer be found 


you’ll feel what i felt 
you’ll sit with your face 



in your hands 


and your heart on the floor because you lost the greatest thing to ever 
happen to you 
me . . . 



silent night. 


sometimes you just need 
to be alone with yourself 
and the silence of solitude 
in order to figure everything out 



a stillness. 


be still and conquer 



again, all over. 


if i could do it all again 
i would’ve loved me more 
instead of waiting on you 



all of me. 


my personality is a secret 
and i can only share it with you 
once you’ve earned my trust 



small and great. 


so much power 
in one little woman 



the anti. 


no tolerance for drama 
no room for fake individuals 
i keep to myself 
because i prefer peace 



books, therapeutic. 


she sat in the corner 
with her face in a book 
hiding from anxiety 
trying not to panic 



connect to. 


while others were searching 
for wi-fi 
i was searching 
for a soul connection 



she, in wonderland. 


where do you go 
when you daydream 
wherever it is 
i imagine 
that you’re happy there 
smiling into the distance 
beautiful while getting lost 



steel curtain. 


protect your energy 
understand that not everyone 
who wants you 
deserves you 


protect your peace of mind 
understand that most people 
don’t even deserve to be a thought 



introvert I. 


i am more myself 
when i am alone 



empty, emptier. 


empty people 
filling themselves 
with people 
who fill them up 
with more emptiness 
more sadness 
more pain 



it lives there. 


silence is a home 
and it houses everything 
i’ll never say 



introvert II. 


sometimes i don’t want to be 
around too many people 
sometimes i just don’t feel like talking 
sometimes i dread 
human interaction 
and i’m not ashamed of that 



sometimes, the silence. 


silence for those 
who either aren’t ready 
to listen 
or don’t deserve 
to hear your thoughts 



oh, shy soul. 


the most intriguing soul 
belongs to the shy human 



introvert III. 


in silence 
i listen 
i observe 
i see all 
i know all 
i understand 
and can’t be fooled 



the trying. 


watching all the people 
trying to fit happiness 
into shopping bags 


noses buried in liquor 
trying to forget 


drowning out the pain 
with loud music 


trying their hardest 
to be content with being hurt 



from heartache. 


let pain inspire 
your power 


let heartache 
inspire your heart 
to grow stronger 



introvert IV. 


i am rarely alone 
when by myself 
i am more alone 
with others 



staying in tonight. 


say “no” more often 
tell them you’re just not interested 
no more doing things 
that you have no desire to do 
for the sake of other people’s feelings 



the introversion. 


people are draining 
i find fullness in being alone 



outgoing, introvert. 


she, a chameleon 
capable of fitting in 
but made to stand out 


an outgoing introvert 
if something like that could exist 
but even in a sea of people 
she still felt alone 



don’t talk to me. 


a phone or a book 
some headphones might do 


all of these things 
which prevent me 
from having to talk to people 


all of these things 
to help me appear 
uninterested 



spring. 


break me open 
and roses will grow 
between the cracks 



k–12. 


i’m tired 
of being tired 
of being around 
people 



start here, with self. 


real love arrives 
when we’re ready 
real love arrives 
when we love ourselves 



hell in mind. 


we carry around hell 
in the form of memories 


moments shared with people 
who no longer mean anything 
to our lives 



more substance, more life. 


i’d go out and party 
then come home to the moon 
an empty home 
and cold bed 


this was no way to live 
i needed more 



one-sided vow. 


being married 
doesn’t save a marriage 
loving someone 
doesn’t make them 
your soul mate 
trying harder 
doesn’t mean 
they’ll try just as much 


going to therapy 
won’t help a person 
who doesn’t think 
they need to change 


your denial 
is your own 
personal prison 



all talk without action. 


he’d say anything 
to make her stay 
but never did enough 
to keep her from leaving 



jealousy, all-consuming. 


you see 
they want you 
to do well 
just not better than them 
the support begins to fade 
the more successful you become 


heart filled with envy 
jealousy consumes their souls 
fake family and friends 
and you’ll have to let them go 



never anything more. 


you were never 
what i needed 
you never became 
the person 
you promised to be 



no end. 


a happy ending is not enough 
i deserve 
i require 
i demand a happiness 
that doesn’t have to end 



reality says. 


we do too much 
for those who don’t do enough 


we give our all 
to those 
who do nothing 


we’re searching for peace 
in relationships 
overrun with hatred 



over all else. 


i care more about 
my own happiness 
than the hatred 
that people feel for me 


i am a priority 
within my own life 
i choose me 
every time 



arm raised. 



most of my critics 



are only critical of me 



because i continue 



to move beyond 



the limitations 
they’ve set on my craft 



and most of the hate 
i’ve received from other writers is derived from 
their inability to achieve what i’ve achieved 



i am totally accepting 



of their defeat 



i am completely content 



with winning 



above the rest. 


when you insult my words 
you insult my readers 


but insulting my art, me 
and my supporters 
does nothing but keep you 
stranded beneath us 



royal. 


Samantha King 
queen of my future 
a ruler on her own 
a warrior 
through and through 



a painful thought. 


it’s the memories 
the painful ones 


what we remember 
poisons the heart 



higher up. 


you belong to the night 
next to the brightest stars 
in sync with the moon 
above the earth 



your own reflection. 


i was a mirror 
in our relationship 
and maybe you left 
because you didn’t like 
what you saw 



a beautiful mess. 


i traveled to the messiest 
parts of her mind 
and found beauty there 



forever summer. 


you make winters feel hot 
i’m in desperate need 
of your warmth 



sad melodies. 


you helped me relate 
to the saddest of songs 
my heart ran blue 
because of you 



introverted war. 


it’s like i want to be alone 
but i want to be touched 



in daydreams. 


she lives inside of her head 
to escape the reality 
surrounding her 



never felt like home. 


home is where the heart 
can feel secure and safe 


i was homeless 
when loving you 



for love, for you. 


but i’d drain the entire ocean 
to keep you from drowning 



an empty love. 


you said enough 
to make me believe 
but never enough 
to keep me from leaving 



foolish denial. 


i let you break me 
then waited for you 
to fix me 



6:05 a.m. 
it happens 
you know 


sometimes 
broken people 
break others 



you were allowed. 


what truly hurts 
is that i was happier 
before you arrived 


and letting you in 
was like inviting chaos 
into my life 
allowing you 
to invade my peace 



all for love, irony. 


isn’t it ironic 
how the need for love 
draws us closer to hate 



the love you desire. 


the best kind of love 
is the one that never ends 
it’s there whenever you need it 
it holds on without letting go 



lights. 


you need only to be with someone 
who brings out the light in you 



be. 


be who you are 
stand tall in what you believe 


accept yourself 
don’t wait for the world 
to love you 



love is many things. 


another person’s sexual orientation 
has nothing to do with you 
and your criticism of who 
they choose to love 
is unimportant and irrelevant 



love, your way. 


do not hide your love 
behind the hatred of others 


do not allow others 
to dictate who 
or how you love 



deep heaven. 


kiss the hell out of the one 
who helps you find heaven 
on earth 



be loud. 


if women 
were silent 
the world 
would lose 
its voice 


if women 
held back 
the world 
would lose 
its strength 



6:31:05 a.m. 
the supporting of women 
the encouraging of women 
the motivation of women 
doesn’t in any way 
equate to hating men 



6:34:30 a.m. 
just because 
you are kind to her 
doesn’t mean 
she owes you sex 



6:37:10 a.m. 
do not trade in your strength 
to make him feel stronger 
do not exchange your voice 
for his comfort 



everything is everything. 


i will always be too much 
of everything 
for someone who is incapable 
of being everything to me 



yours truly. 


your beauty is yours 
your body is yours 
you are yours 


you don’t exist for them 



a danger. 


sadly 
the biggest danger to us all 
are the people we trust 


they have the keys 
to violate us in the worst of ways 



you’re not worthy. 


disliking you as much 
as you hate me 
would require 
an emotional commitment 
that you don’t deserve 



moving on, self-love. 


it ended 
because i realized 
that you didn’t love me 
like i love me 



none. 


no tolerance for 
racism 
sexism 
and homophobia 
zero tolerance 
for anyone 
who thrives upon hatred 



8:29:10 a.m. 
without a doubt 
i can 
and i will 
free myself 



below busy feet. 


the busy have no time 
to respond to the criticism 
from those hating below them 



Aries. 


the goal is to avoid boredom 
and never grow content with being lazy 
or doing nothing 



the mundane. 



i seem to attract hatred 



and criticism 



from people who are content 



with achieving less than me 


i find that these individuals travel in packs, fueled by hatred or their 
inability to accomplish the things that the people they hate on have done 


they’re always so mundane 
and boring with their lackluster and unoriginal insults 


screaming loud but their voices muffled under their ignorance stretching out 
their bitter, short arms toward people like me 
yet i remain out of reach 



almost untouchable 
and they’ll always be laughable to say the least 



more reading, more peace. 


i’ve gone mad 
and the library 
is my asylum 
my peace of mind 
my heaven on earth 



from voices, we evolve. 


speak, woman 
tell me everything 
tell the world 
do not be silent 
yell if you need to 
i want to listen 
i want to learn from you 
i want to evolve 
based upon your wisdom 
you inspire a difference 


come, speak 
change the world 



everyone and their opinions. 


do not allow the path 
of your life 
to be altered by people 
who have no path 
to follow 



painful conclusion. 


no one is hurting more 
than the people 
who are silent about the pain 
that lives within their souls 



why i write. 


i write poetry 
because it’s much easier 
to write it down 
than to say it out loud 
without breaking down 



lying in the mirror. 


you can lie to others 
sometimes successfully 
but you can’t tell a lie 
to yourself successfully 
because no matter what you do 
every night before you fall asleep 
the truth will look you in the eye 
and burn a hole within your mind 



inspired self. 


be inspired 
by the pain you feel 
and your heart’s ability 
to keep fighting 


you are powerful 
mighty beyond measure 



she, godly. 


she could calm the ocean 
with a glance 
she could quiet a storm 
with a whisper 


all-powerful 
all-beautiful and all-knowing 


she’s a woman 
and that made her 
some sort of god 



broken, a healing process. 



being broken is the beginning 


it’s the process of rediscovering what it means to feel whole once more some 
of you may believe 
that getting hurt is the end 
but the pain that you experience 
gives way to a path that may lead to something more beautiful 
or stronger than what you’ve had 


it’s okay to feel hurt 
there’s nothing wrong 



with feeling broken 



the pain is never easy 



but never be ashamed 
to feel whatever it is you feel 
do not think less of yourself 
because of someone’s inability 
to do more or give you more 



of what you deserve 



our ending, new beginnings. 


i’ll be the one 
you couldn’t keep 
i’ll be the memory 
that hurts the most 
i’ll be the greatest loss 
in your life 
i’ll be the one 
you’ll never be able 
to come back to 


all because i love me more 
than you ever could 



someone, searching for you. 


you don’t know it yet 



but there is love lurking 



around the corner 


there is something truly beautiful waiting for you in the distance you don’t 
know it yet 



but there is someone 



searching for someone 



with a love like yours 



there is someone 



searching for someone 



who can love them 



the way you do 



it gets better, hold on. 



three years ago 



i wrote myself a note 
i wrote a letter to others as well 



detailing the pain 
and suffering that lived within my soul 



three years ago 


in that letter, the note i wrote down from my heart my mind, my wretched 
soul detailing what was next a desire to take my last breaths three years ago 



i wanted to die 



three years later 



i feel so fucking alive 



:38 after. 


away i go 
conflicted 
broken like glass 
for a love 
that wasn’t real 



no space. 


you see 
this is what i get 
trying to force my love 
in places 
where it was never meant 
to fit 



OCD I. 


i understand 
no judgment here 
we all need to be 
in control of something 


you don’t have to be ashamed 
you don’t need to hide this from me 



OCD II. 


your ability 
to be orderly 
is not some disease 


your desire 
to maintain control 
is not some disease 


your rituals 
are simply several attempts 
to get it right 


your desire 
to achieve order 
is not a disorder 



a beautiful composition. 



i wanted to tell you 
that the OCD is not a curse 
it’s just a gift that the world doesn’t understand 



i wanted to tell you 



that the anxiety you feel 
is just proof of your ability 
to feel deeper levels of emotion that others may not be able 



to comprehend 



i wanted to tell you 
that the depression you experience causes you to view the world 



from a perspective that goes 



beyond the surface 
a surface that so many minds 
can’t handle 
and that in itself makes you rare and mighty, you’re strong 


the world says you’re broken 
but that just means you’re beautiful to me 



untitled II. 


you are beautiful 
you are powerful 
you are rare 
you are grand 
you are majestic 


your broken 
is a gift 
the pain 
will make you 
stronger 


keep fighting 
continue to survive 


i’ll fight beside you 



April 1st. 


she doesn’t have to look good 
for you 
wear makeup for you 
be thin for you 
cook and clean for you 


she is not for you 
she doesn’t belong to you 



a true form of love. 


real love isn’t something 
you force 
real love is not something 
you compete for 
real love will never have you 
compromise your peace and joy 



April 2nd I. 


demand the love you deserve 
and be willing to walk away 
from anyone who refuses 
to reciprocate the love 
you provide 



April 2nd II. 


no woman should feel like 
she has to try harder for someone 
who isn’t trying for her 



April 2nd III. 


it’s not your fault 
you were never the problem 
you can’t be everything 
to someone 
who deserves nothing 
from you 



i now know. 


you could never be 
what i needed 
you were nothing close 
to what i deserved 



everything was nothing. 


i will no longer search 
for my everything 
in a relationship with someone 
who does nothing to keep me 



this love of self. 


deeply and truly 
i love me, so much 



April 5th I. 


talking shit about others 
won’t reduce the shit 
in your life 



April 5th II. 


listen and understand 
you will need me 
before i ever need you 
and knowing this is my power 



no suffering. 


i don’t suffer from OCD 
i thrive from it 



no. 


never apologize 
for saying no to the things 
you didn’t truly want 



wounds. 


one day 
every scar on your heart 
will make sense 



spectrum. 


she is color 
in a world painted gray 



searching the wrong place. 


do not search for comfort 
in the same heart 
that destroyed yours 



never, nowhere. 


if you missed me 
you’d show up 
if you missed me 
you’d be here 



pure strength. 


i have seen true power 
in the eyes of a woman 
who felt broken 
but kept fighting 


i have witnessed 
a warrior’s strength 
while watching 
a woman survive 



22 minutes after forever. 


the ink in my pen 
swells with the urge to write 
thoughts coming together 
to create words describing you 
stories told beneath the moon 
under a desk light as you sleep 
tonight reminds me of love 
and how much you truly 
mean to me 



2:03:10 a.m. 
i forgot about myself 
while trying to remember you 



the changes, it’s over. 


we ended 
like seasons changing 
we disappeared 
into a rainy fog 



revive. 


i breathe life into poetry 
with every keystroke 
my fingers in motion 
i revive what was thought 
to be dead 



the bookstores. 


every bookstore 
is a museum 
the keeper of words 
the holder of my art form 
my thoughts on display 
a resting place for my books 



march, scream, fight. 


no more silence 
my voice raised with others 
who think as openly as me 
screaming yes for gender equality 
fists up in solitude for equal rights 



from that to now. 


how do you destroy 
the woman 
when you were created 
in her womb 



give, receive. 


teach her that love 
is not only in giving 
remind her that she too 
deserves to receive 
a love that doesn’t force 
her soul to weep 



kingless. 


she’s single 
which makes her 
a kingless queen 
and that’s okay 



live your own life. 


life begins again 
once you stop living the way 
society taught you 



unwanted. 


unwanted sexual attention 
harms the mind 
hurts the heart 
and bothers the soul 


stop 
stop 
stop 



winter within. 


we grow colder 
the longer we hold on 
to anything that isn’t 
good for our soul 



the mourning of. 


wearing the color black 
mourning the loss of myself 
the fracture of my innocence 
the cracks in my heart 



silent night. 


you asked me how i felt 
and silence was my response 
because nothing was what i felt 



the unconditional. 


you won’t leave right away your heart will break 
your mind will grow weary and your soul 



will long for more 
but you’ll reach 
for the person who pushed you to the edge 
because you’re in love 
and that love is unconditional that love is beautiful 



that love is pure 
that love should be given to yourself 



more than stars. 


while the stars 
compete for the moon’s attention 
she is the only light 
that i search for in darkness 



wearing masks. 


i’m fine 
i’m okay 
i’m just tired 
i’ve been hurting 
the happiness 
is the mask 
that hides 
all emotional truth 
and i’ve been hiding 
all of me 
from all of you 



no. 1 in April. 


these words pour from me 
like rain from foggy skies 
i often fear that i’ll drown 
in my own pool of sadness 
submerged, reaching for no one 
because only i can save me 
i have always saved myself 



no. 2 in April. 



what are we 



where are you 



did you get my call 



did you get my text 



what do you feel 



do you miss me 



what are we 
where do we go from here am i wasting my heart on you are you the one 
are you seeing other people are we exclusive 



do you love me 


why am i asking questions that i should know the answers to why do i feel 
the need to question you 



and yet you never answer 



little Raymond. 


and to the Raymonds of the world the underachievers 
who mumble underneath their breath when in the same room 



as the overachiever 


i hope you find your way 
out of the pit of your own failures i hope you find some peace 
among the chaos you’ve created i wish you well 
as you continuously defame others to make up for your own shortcomings 


how sad, how weak 



love, your love. 


it’s okay to love whatever 
or whomever you love 
even if what you love 
isn’t accepted by others 



April in New York. 


my April is colder 
than usual 
my April pours rain 
like Seattle 
my April hides the sun 
behind its clouds 
my April is gloomy 
like a sky painted gray 



standing in truth. 



there are times 
when i don’t want 



to be strong 



there are moments 
when i’d rather not smile there are days 
when i feel like screaming there are nights 
when i crumble into the darkness of the night 
for years i’ve been fighting and most days i want to quit so many years of 


surviving and tonight i feel like shit and i’m not afraid or ashamed to admit 
that i’m not okay i’m far from fine 


a long way from being happy this is it, my honesty 
i will stand in my truth i will stand when it hurts i will stand even when i feel 
like falling 



the city of sin. 



cigar smoke dancing 



in my lungs 
the city’s vices on display for everyone to see 



the music loud 



the people in a daze 
high off life’s drug 
some pretending to be happy most of all everyone 
trying to escape their daily woes i suppose i’m sort of like them here in this 


moment 



trying to chase away 
whatever it is that’s been weighing me down 



i needed to get away 



and this is it 



me among family 
me, filled with peace 



6:29:10. 
my mind 
a museum of madness 
my heart 
a museum of pain 



all the lonely people. 


the club was often interesting 
but rarely fun 
weirdly i thought 
the remedy for my loneliness 
was to go to a place 
filled with lonelier people 



the next morning. 


the club was just a place 



where people were celebrating 



their struggles 



by drinking to get away 
from all the fucked-up things 



that occur in their lives 



a temporary distraction 



from all the things 



that will still be there 



when the music stops playing 


a loneliness that will still be there in the morning after the stranger leaves the 
club has been prescribed 



to anyone going through 


whatever they’re going through but just as i’ve found out for myself the club 
won’t save you 



observations in sin city. 


there’s a difference between 



being wanted and being loved 


and i realized this even more 
while in the lobby of the hotel in Vegas, a place that also entertained 
thousands of people with a casino restaurants and clubs 



i watched men and women 



stumble in drunken misery 
some alone, others together 



finding each other but only 



for the moment 
i held my fiancée a little tighter that night 



the finish. 



to the eyes fixated 



on this page 



to the heart 



that feels broken 



to the mind 



that feels tired 



to the voice 
that struggles to speak to the voice 



that struggles 



to be heard 



to the voice 



that the world 
has attempted to silence i hope you found 
a truth in these words i hope you found 



the inspiration 



to keep fighting 



to keep living 



to keep surviving 



to keep speaking 



to keep going 


i hope you found strength in these words 
i hope you found something that’ll motivate your soul to keep pursuing 
or going after all the things you deserve 


thank you for giving me your attention 



until next time 



keep fighting 



keep fighting 



keep fighting 



keep fighting
